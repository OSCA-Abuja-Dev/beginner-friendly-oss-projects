Welcome to the OSCA Abuja projects repository! Our goal is to provide a platform where community members and developers can easily participate in open source projects. To achieve this, we have curated a list of beginner-friendly open source projects in this repository. By doing so, we aim to lower the barriers to entry for individuals who are new to open source, allowing them to gain experience and confidence in contributing to the community.

This README file outlines Open Source projects and detailed steps on how to contribute to each one.
